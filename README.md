# K8sQuest 🕹️⚙️
Learn Kubernetes by fixing it.

K8sQuest is a **local, game-based Kubernetes training platform** with an interactive GUI-like terminal interface. Each mission breaks something in Kubernetes. Your job is to fix it.

**50 progressive challenges across 5 worlds** - from beginner to advanced.

No cloud. No AWS. No costs.

## Features

- 📊 **Real-time Monitoring** - Watch Kubernetes resources update live with "check" command
- 💡 **Progressive Hints** - Unlocks gradually as you need help
- 📚 **Step-by-Step Guides** - Beginner-friendly walkthroughs when you need them
- **Post-Mission Debriefs** - Learn WHY your fix worked with real-world examples
- 🎯 **Clear Mission Briefings** - Know difficulty, time estimate, and concepts
- 🏆 **XP & Progress System** - Track your learning journey and achievements
- 🎮 **Multi-Terminal Workflow** - Learn real-world debugging patterns
- 💾 **Auto-Save Progress** - Never lose your achievements
- 🔄 **Reset Levels** - Get stuck? Clean slate anytime

## 🛡️ Safety First

K8sQuest includes **comprehensive safety guards** (enabled by default):
- ✅ Prevents deletion of critical namespaces (kube-system, default, etc.)
- ✅ Blocks destructive cluster-wide operations
- ✅ Limits operations to `k8squest` namespace via RBAC
- ✅ Confirms risky operations before execution
- ✅ Safe for beginners - hard to break things!

## Requirements
- Docker Desktop (running)
- kubectl
- kind
- bash
- python3
- jq

## Quick Start
```bash
# One-time setup
./install.sh

# Start playing
./play.sh
```

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start the game** - Run `./play.sh` (keeps the game running)
2. **Read the mission briefing** - Understand what's broken  
3. **OPEN A NEW TERMINAL** ⚠️ - Keep the game running in the first terminal!
4. **Use kubectl to investigate** - Check pods, logs, and events in the NEW terminal
5. **Fix the issue** - Apply corrections using kubectl commands
6. **Return to game terminal** - Choose an action (check/validate/guide)
7. **Earn XP** - Complete missions to level up!

## 🎯 Available Commands During Play

- `check` - Monitor resource status in real-time (watch for changes!)
- `guide` - Show step-by-step solution walkthrough *(Coming soon - will be updated in future)*
- `hints` - Display progressive hints (unlocks more on each use)
- `solution` - View the solution.yaml file
- `validate` - Test if your solution works
- `skip` - Skip to the next level (no XP awarded)
- `quit` - Exit the game (progress is auto-saved)

## 🎓 Post-Mission Debriefs

After completing each mission, you'll get a detailed debrief explaining:
- ✅ What actually happened and why
- 🧠 The correct mental model for this concept
- 🚨 Real-world production incident examples
- 💼 Interview questions you can now answer
- 🔧 kubectl commands you mastered

**This is where the real learning happens!**

## 🔧 Reset Levels

Get stuck or want to retry? Reset any level from any world:
```bash
# First, activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Reset levels from any world
python3 engine/reset.py level-1-pods                # World 1
python3 engine/reset.py level-15-rollout            # World 2
python3 engine/reset.py level-28-endpoints          # World 3
python3 engine/reset.py level-38-volume-permissions # World 4
python3 engine/reset.py level-45-node-affinity      # World 5
```

Or reset everything:
```bash
python3 engine/reset.py all
```
