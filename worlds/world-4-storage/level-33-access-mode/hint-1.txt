🔍 HINT 1: Observing the Problem

Let's check the current configuration:

1️⃣ Check pod status:
   kubectl get pods -n k8squest -l app=web
   
   You'll likely see all 3 pods Running (because Kind is single-node).
   But is this the RIGHT configuration for production?

2️⃣ Check the PVC access mode:
   kubectl get pvc shared-pvc -n k8squest -o yaml | grep -A2 accessModes
   
   What's the access mode? ReadWriteOnce or ReadWriteMany?

3️⃣ Check the PV access mode:
   kubectl get pv shared-storage -o yaml | grep -A2 accessModes
   
   Does it match what you need for multiple pods?

4️⃣ Run validation to see if configuration is correct:
   ./validate.sh
   
   The validation checks for CORRECT configuration, not just whether pods run!

📝 Key Observation:
In Kind (single-node), ReadWriteOnce works because all pods are on the same node.
But in production multi-node clusters, pods on different nodes can't mount RWO volumes!

🤔 Questions:
• What is ReadWriteOnce? (Hint: one NODE, not one pod)
• What is ReadWriteMany?
• Which mode do you need for shared storage across nodes?
