🎯 HINT 2: Understanding Access Modes

The problem is the access mode is wrong for multi-node shared storage!

📚 Access Modes Explained:

**ReadWriteOnce (RWO)**
- Volume can be mounted by ONE node only
- Multiple pods on SAME node can share it
- Most common mode, works with most storage types
```yaml
accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce  # ❌ Not for multi-node deployments with shared storage
```

**ReadWriteMany (RWX)**
- Volume can be mounted by MULTIPLE nodes simultaneously
- All pods across any nodes can share it
- Requires network storage (NFS, CephFS, etc.)
```yaml
accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany  # ✅ Perfect for shared content across nodes
```

**ReadOnlyMany (ROX)**
- Multiple nodes can mount, but read-only
- Good for static content distribution

🔍 Your Situation:

In Kind (single-node):
- All 3 pods run fine with ReadWriteOnce (all on same node)
- But this is WRONG for production multi-node clusters!

In Production (multi-node):
- Deployment with 3 replicas spreads across nodes
- With ReadWriteOnce, only pods on first node can mount
- Other pods stuck: "Volume already exclusively attached"

💡 The Solution:
Change to ReadWriteMany in BOTH PV and PVC!

⚠️  But here's the catch: You can't just edit the PVC...
You'll discover why when you try to apply the fix!
