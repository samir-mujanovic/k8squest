description: |
  Multiple pods need to share the same storage volume across nodes, but the storage
  is configured with ReadWriteOnce instead of ReadWriteMany.
  
  SCENARIO: This level runs on Kind (single-node), so all 3 pods will appear to work.
  However, the configuration is WRONG for production multi-node clusters. The validation
  will detect this, and you'll also learn that PVC specs are immutable when you try to fix it!
  
  This teaches TWO lessons: (1) correct access mode selection, (2) PVC immutability.
  
learning_objectives:
  - Understand PV/PVC access modes (RWO, RWX, ROX)
  - Learn when to use ReadWriteOnce vs ReadWriteMany
  - Configure storage for multi-pod shared access
  - Experience PVC spec immutability (accessModes cannot be edited)
  - Learn delete/recreate workflow for fixing immutable fields
