✅ HINT 3: Complete Solution

Fix: Change accessModes from ReadWriteOnce to ReadWriteMany

📝 In PersistentVolume:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: shared-storage
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany  # ✅ Changed from ReadWriteOnce
```

📝 In PersistentVolumeClaim:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: shared-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany  # ✅ Changed from ReadWriteOnce
```

🚀 Apply:
```bash
# IMPORTANT: PVC spec is immutable - must delete and recreate!
kubectl delete deployment web-servers -n k8squest
kubectl delete pvc shared-pvc -n k8squest
kubectl delete pv shared-storage

# Apply the corrected configuration
kubectl apply -f solution.yaml

# Watch all 3 pods start successfully
kubectl get pods -n k8squest -l app=web -w
```

⚠️  **Why delete first?** PVC's accessModes cannot be changed after creation.
You must delete the PVC and PV, then recreate them with the correct access mode.

💡 Remember: Both PV and PVC must have matching access modes!
