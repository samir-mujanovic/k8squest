🎯 HINT 2: Base64 is NOT Encryption!

⚠️ **Critical Concept:** The Secret in this level IS properly base64-encoded, 
but base64 encoding provides NO security!

📚 Understanding the Difference:

**Encoding (Base64):**
- Purpose: Convert binary data to text format
- Reversible: Anyone can decode instantly
- No key required
- Example: base64 -d reveals everything
- ❌ Provides ZERO security

**Encryption (AES, RSA, etc.):**
- Purpose: Hide data from unauthorized access  
- Requires a secret key to decrypt
- Cannot be reversed without the key
- ✅ Actually provides security

🔍 Demonstrating the Problem:

```bash
# Get the "encoded" username
kubectl get secret db-credentials -n k8squest -o jsonpath='{.data.username}'
# Output: YWRtaW4=

# Decode it instantly (no key needed!)
kubectl get secret db-credentials -n k8squest -o jsonpath='{.data.username}' | base64 -d
# Output: admin

# Same with password
kubectl get secret db-credentials -n k8squest -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
# Output: secretpass123
```

🚨 The Security Issue:
- Anyone with `kubectl get secret` access can read all secrets
- Base64 looks like encryption but it's just encoding
- Secrets are stored in etcd (also just base64, not encrypted by default)
- This is why RBAC and encryption-at-rest are critical!

💡 What's the Solution?

The level validator checks for proper security measures. Think about:
1. How to prevent unauthorized access to secrets (RBAC)
2. How to encrypt secrets at rest (etcd encryption)
3. How to use external secret management (Vault, Sealed Secrets, etc.)
