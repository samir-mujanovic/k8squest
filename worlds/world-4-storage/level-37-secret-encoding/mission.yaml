description: |
  The database credentials are stored in a Kubernetes Secret using base64 encoding.
  But here's the critical lesson: base64 is NOT encryption - it's just encoding!
  Anyone with kubectl access can decode these "secrets" instantly.
  
  This level demonstrates why proper secret management requires more than just
  Kubernetes Secrets. You need encryption-at-rest, RBAC, and ideally external
  secret managers like Vault or Sealed Secrets.
  
learning_objectives:
  - Understand the difference between encoding and encryption
  - Learn why base64 provides zero security
  - Discover how easily Secrets can be decoded
  - Explore proper secret management strategies
