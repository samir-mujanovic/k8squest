🔍 HINT 1: Understanding Secret Encoding

⚠️ **Critical Discovery:** Secrets use base64 encoding, but that's NOT encryption!

Let's investigate why this is a security issue:

1️⃣ Check pod status:
   kubectl get pod database-client -n k8squest
   
   The pod should be Running (the Secret is valid!)

2️⃣ Check the Secret:
   kubectl get secret db-credentials -n k8squest -o yaml
   
   Look at the "data" section - values appear encoded with base64

3️⃣ Decode the username:
   kubectl get secret db-credentials -n k8squest -o jsonpath='{.data.username}' | base64 -d
   
   Output: admin

4️⃣ Decode the password:
   kubectl get secret db-credentials -n k8squest -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
   
   Output: secretpass123

📝 Key Observation:
Base64 encoding is just ENCODING, not ENCRYPTION!
Anyone with kubectl access can decode secrets instantly.

🤔 The Problem:
• base64 looks secure but provides ZERO security
• It's just encoding (like UTF-8 or ASCII)
• kubectl get secret ... | base64 -d reveals everything
• Secrets stored in etcd are also just base64 (not encrypted by default)

💡 What You Need to Learn:
How is base64 encoding different from encryption, and what should you use instead?
